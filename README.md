# SingleThetaCluster
 
This code (includes Step1, Step2, Step3)show how cluster individual theta cycle of LFP recorded in hippocampal CA1 pyrmidal layer into four clusters:slow gamma; median gamma; early high gamma and late high gamma through k-means clustering;

The code corresponds the method we proposed in the publication at elife 2019; https://elifesciences.org/articles/44320

%%%%toolbox needed:
%%%%Toolbox 1:buzsaki Lab code for processing hc-11 data; not necessary if use your own
%%%%data:https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode

%%%%Toolbox 2:Comunity Clustering;not necessary if only try k-means
%%%%clustering;http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain


%%%%%%%Step 1 includes loading hc-11 data;please download the data first if not use your own data;
%% https://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-11/about-hc-11

%%%%%%%Step 2 prepare data samples for clustering; 
%%%%%%%LFP, filtered LFP in theta band,LFP theta phase is needed;

%%%%%%%Step 3-1:k-means clustering and 4 theta-gamma asignment;

%%%%%%%Step 3-2:community clustering;
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Noted that this process is time coumsing when data sample is large.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%In this demo, only the first 5000 samples were used; It
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%cost ~1 hour calculation if use all samples in this demo;
